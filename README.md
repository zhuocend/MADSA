## The project of paper "Adversarial Attacks and Defense for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimal Dispatching in an Active Distribution Network"

This work proposed a adversarial attack method named "Multi-Agent Directed Shift Attack (MADSA)" to Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimal Dispatching in an Active Distribution Network.

Using the following command to obtain the project:

```git clone https://github.com/zhuocend/MADSA.git```

run ```Test_Env.py``` to test the STD models and the attack methods.
